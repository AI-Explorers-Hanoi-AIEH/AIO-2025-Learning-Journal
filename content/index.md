# AI Explorers Hanoi (AEIH)

_AIO2025 Learning Journal_

We are a group of curious learners participating in **AIO2025**, a program designed to guide us through the fundamentals and applications of Artificial Intelligence. Our backgrounds are diverse - some of us are students, others are early-career professionals or career switchers. What connects us is our shared commitment to **learning deeply**, **asking questions**, and **growing steadily**.

## Modules
[[Module 1]]


✍️ Why This Blog?

Inspired by the **Feynman Technique**, we believe the best way to truly understand something is to **explain it in our own words**. This blog is our shared space to:

- 🧠 Reflect on what we’ve learned
- 🔍 Break down complex concepts simply
- 📚 Reinforce our understanding through writing

### 💡 Our Learning Values

- 🎯 **Clarity over complexity** - If we can’t explain it simply, we don’t understand it well enough.
- 🤝 **Collaboration over competition** - We learn faster by learning together.
- 🧭 **Consistency over perfection** - Progress matters more than flawless output.

### 📌 What You’ll See Here

- Weekly summaries of our study sessions
- Concept breakdowns in plain language
- Personal learning logs and progress notes

> “If you want to master something, teach it.” - Richard Feynman

This is our way of teaching ourselves - and maybe helping others learn too.
