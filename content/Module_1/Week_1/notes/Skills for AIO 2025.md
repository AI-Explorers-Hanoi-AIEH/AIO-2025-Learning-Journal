Several platforms where students can search for scholarly resources are introduced:

- **Google Scholar** ([scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/)): General academic search engine.
- **IEEE Xplore:** For computer science and engineering papers.
- **PubMed:** Biomedical and life sciences literature.
- **Springer / ScienceDirect:** Broader access to multidisciplinary journals.
- **arXiv / bioRxiv:** Preprint archives for computer science, physics, and biology.
- **PapersWithCode:** Combines papers with code implementations.
- **AIO Q&A Facebook Group:** A community forum for peer support and competition insights

This section introduces the structured reading strategies and how we can utilize LLM to support academic reading:

- **Key Sections** to prioritize: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Proposed Method, and Experimental Results.
- **Guidelines by ChatGPT**: A 7-step process including skimming, analyzing methods, interpreting tables, and discussing with peers.
- **NotebookLM:** Upload and summarize academic papers interactively

### **3. Making a Research Plan**

This section shows how to generate a research plan using **Gemini AI**, including:

- Literature review techniques.
- Identifying key models, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.
- Defining next research steps and using structured prompts to frame ideas clearly.

### üíª Part 2: Basic Programming (Python) Skills for AIO Projects

This portion introduced tools and techniques for implementing and documenting Python code.

### **1. Coding Environments**

- **Jupyter Notebook** and **Google Colab** were demonstrated.
- Installation methods via Python or Anaconda.
- Instructions to create, save, and reopen notebooks.
- Integration with **Google Drive** for loading and processing files (e.g., displaying images).

### **2. Using AI Assistants (Colab AI & ChatGPT)**

Hands-on examples included:

- Generating Python code and visualizations.
- Explaining code, debugging, and adding comments.
- Writing basic algorithms and summarizing technical content.

### **3. Documenting Results with LaTeX (Overleaf)**
